"# JavaFXProject" 

This project is an attempt to learn more about graphic user interface design with Java, and how to connect an SQLite Database to a Java Project. 

I implemented skills in SQL, Java, CSS, and XML to build this project. 

The project simply allows for the creation of users in the system, and stores their information in a database to allow for a Log In functionality.
